Our goal is to use Google Docs as a learning Tool within the boundaries of any LMS, **Moodle** in particular since the base technology is developed at http://code.google.com/p/basiclti4moodle another one of our projects.

**An Example** A teacher creates an assignment. This assignment will be completed by the student in a Google Docs Document (Word processor, Spreadsheet, Slideshow, Image ... ). The teacher will be able to see the work, its progress, make annotations, and grade it on the LMS.

Since is a project aimed for educational use:

**About Privacy**: While the LMS needs to know what Google account the student is using, Google does not need to know the binding between the Google account and the LMS Student account. If the student does not wish to use GDocs she can upload a file to the LMS instead.

June 2010 **New release of the code** - The current code release is working propertly and complies witha the IMS test BLTI Framework. Cool.

**BasicLTI4Moodle** is a IMS BasicLTI (Basic Learning Tools for Interoperability) consumer for **Moodle 1.9** and **Moodle 2.0**. **BasicLTI is a IMS Standard** that allows web based learning tools to be easily integrated in LMS as native ones. The IMS BasicLTI specification is part of the [IMS standard Common Cartridge 1.1](http://imsglobal.org) Sakai and other main LMS are already supporting or going to support BasicLTI. This project Implements the consumer for Moodle. [Moodle](http://moodle.org) is a Free Open source Learning Management System by Martin Dougiamas.

BasicLTI4Moodle is a project iniciated and leaded by Ludo(Marc Alier) and Jordi Piguillem  at the GESSI research group at [UPC](http://www.upc.edu).

[SimpleLTI](http://simplelti.appspot.com) consumer for Moodle is an implementation of the early specification of LTI by Charles Severance (Dr Chuck) , developed by Jordi Piguillem in a Google Summer of Code 2008 project co-mentored by Charles Severance and Marc Alier.
